# Question 4.2 
# The iris data set iris.txt contains 150 data points, each with four predictor 
# variables and one categorical response. The predictors are the width and length of the sepal and petal of 
# flowers and the response is the type of flower. The data is available from the R library datasets and can be
# accessed with iris once the library is loaded. It is also available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository
# (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris ). The response values are only given to see how well a specific 
# method performed and should not be used to build the model.
# Use the R function kmeans to cluster the points as well as possible.
# Report the best combination of predictors, your suggested value of k, and how well your best clustering predicts flower type.
